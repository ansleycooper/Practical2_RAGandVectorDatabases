Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	redis	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	 Yes, transactions in a database system typically obtain locks on data when they perform both read and write operations. Locks help maintain the integrity of the data by preventing multiple transactions from accessing or modifying the same data simultaneously, which could lead to inconsistencies or errors. Different types of locks (e.g., shared locks for reading and exclusive locks for writing) are used depending on the operation being performed.	0.457744121552
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	redis	all-mpnet-base-v2	 Yes, transactions in a database system often obtain locks on data when they perform read or write operations to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts among multiple concurrent transactions. This process is known as locking. The type of lock (e.g., shared lock for reading or exclusive lock for writing) depends on the specific transaction operation. However, the exact implementation can vary based on the database management system used.	0.411661624908
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	redis	nomic-embed-text-v1	 Yes, in many database systems, transactions do obtain locks on data when they read or write. This is known as locking and it's a mechanism used to ensure data consistency during concurrent transactions. When a transaction reads or writes data, it requests a lock, preventing other transactions from modifying the same data until the first transaction is completed. However, the specifics of how locks are implemented can vary between different database systems.	0.421769440174
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	chromadb	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	 Yes, transactions in a database system often obtain locks on data when they read or write to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions. There are different types of locks, such as shared (S) locks for reading and exclusive (X) locks for writing, and locking strategies like row-level locking and table-level locking. The locking mechanism prevents a transaction from modifying data that another transaction is currently accessing, ensuring the integrity of the data in the database system.	1.0418393940388482
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	chromadb	all-mpnet-base-v2	 Yes, transactions can acquire locks on data while reading or writing in a database system to ensure consistency and prevent conflicts. This is known as locking or concurrency control. The type of lock (shared or exclusive) depends on whether the transaction only intends to read the data (shared lock) or modify it (exclusive lock). If multiple transactions try to access the same data at the same time, the one that acquired a lock first will be granted access while others wait in line until the lock is released. This mechanism helps maintain the integrity of the database and prevents issues like inconsistent data or transaction rollbacks.	1.259227223689683
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	chromadb	nomic-embed-text-v1	 Yes, transactions typically obtain locks on data when they read or write in a database system. This is to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts among concurrent transactions. The type of lock depends on the operation (read or write) and can be either shared or exclusive. A shared lock allows multiple transactions to read the same data simultaneously, while an exclusive lock grants only one transaction write access at a time. When a transaction holds a lock, other transactions must wait for it to complete before they can access the locked data. This mechanism is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the database and ensuring that updates are not overwritten or lost due to concurrent changes.	424.95290396486837
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	QdrantClient	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	 No, optimistic concurrency says that transactions do not obtain locks on data when they read or write it. It is considered optimistic because it assumes conflicts are unlikely to occur even if there is a conflict. Optimistic concurrency works well for low conflict systems where the consequences of a conflict can be handled by rolling back and rerunning a transaction that encounters a conflict, which is less efficient than locking schemes used in pessimistic models. However, it allows for higher concurrency.	0.4790803
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	QdrantClient	all-mpnet-base-v2	 In Acid alternative for distributed systems, transactions do not always obtain locks on data when they read or write due to eventual consistency. This is because data stores in these systems don't require write consistency or mutual consistency across replicas. Instead, the system will eventually become consistent when writes stop, ensuring the data becomes consistent over time without the need for locking during each operation. However, specific implementation details may vary depending on the particular database system used.	0.37038642
Do Transactions obtain locks on data when they read or write?	QdrantClient	nomic-embed-text-v1	" In most database systems, transactions acquire locks on data while they are being written, but not necessarily during reading. This mechanism is used to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions. When a transaction writes to a piece of data, it acquires an exclusive lock, preventing other transactions from modifying the same data until the first transaction has completed its write operation.

However, when a transaction reads data, it typically acquires a shared (or read) lock. This allows multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently without causing conflicts. It's only when one of those reading transactions attempts to modify the data that an exclusive lock would be acquired, if another transaction already holds a write lock or has begun a write operation on the same data.

The specific locking behavior can vary between different databases and transaction isolation levels. For example, in some systems, strict consistency may require a transaction to wait for any conflicting writes before it begins reading data, even if the reads themselves don't conflict with those writes. On the other hand, in others, a transaction could read uncommitted data that is later rolled back (known as dirty reads), but would not be allowed to write to the same data while another transaction holds a write lock.

It's always important to understand the specific locking behavior of your chosen database system when designing and implementing multi-transaction applications."	0.44040897
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	redis	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	" The Coordination Allocation Principle (CAP), also known as Brewer's theorem, states that in distributed systems you cannot simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. However, this principle is more relevant to multi-node distributed databases rather than a single-node database like MongoDB.

In a single-node MongoDB instance, data consistency and availability are maintained as expected because there's no partitioning involved (since it's a single node). The CAP theorem doesn't make sense in this context because the conditions for demonstrating its implications are not met."	0.51736676693
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	redis	all-mpnet-base-v2	" The CAP theorem, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, is primarily designed to guide distributed database systems. A single-node MongoDB instance operates as a centralized system rather than a distributed one, making it inconsistent with the conditions required by the CAP theorem to experience partitions (a state where nodes are unable to communicate).

In a single-node setup, consistency is guaranteed due to data being stored on only one node. Availability is also maintained since there's no risk of unavailability from network partitions as there's no other nodes to partition from. As such, the CAP principle doesn't apply to a single-node MongoDB instance in the same way it does for distributed systems that can potentially face the challenges addressed by the theorem."	0.545063495636
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	redis	nomic-embed-text-v1	 The Coordination Among Processes (CAP) theorem is a concept that primarily applies to distributed systems where multiple nodes are involved in processing and storing data. In a single-node system like a standalone MongoDB instance, there's no need for coordination among processes because all the data resides on a single node. Therefore, the CAP theorem doesn't directly apply to such systems as they inherently fulfill the Consistency (C) requirement by design due to the absence of concurrent processing across multiple nodes. However, it's essential to note that MongoDB instances still maintain consistency within their operation principles.	0.424672663212
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	chromadb	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	 The CAP principle does not apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because in such a setup, consistency, availability, and partition tolerance are all maintained simultaneously. In a single-node system, data is stored in one place, so consistency (every read receives the most recent write) and availability (every request results in a response) are guaranteed. Since there is no possibility of network partitions or multiple copies of the data, partition tolerance does not come into play. However, as you scale out MongoDB across multiple nodes, the CAP theorem starts to apply, and trade-offs need to be made among consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.	1.3056766269562836
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	chromadb	all-mpnet-base-v2	" The CAP principle, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, doesn't directly apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because in such a setup, the system doesn't need to handle network partitions. In a single-node database, both consistency and availability are prioritized as data modifications are made on a single node and there's no need for partition tolerance since all nodes are operating together.

However, when MongoDB is deployed in a distributed setup, the principles of CAP become more relevant. In such cases, it's essential to understand how the system will balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance based on the chosen replication strategy and data consistency level."	1.2179050240151477
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	chromadb	nomic-embed-text-v1	 The CAP principle, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, is designed to explain the tradeoffs that must be made among these three properties in distributed systems. In a single-node system like a standalone MongoDB instance, there's no need to consider partition tolerance because there's only one node. Therefore, it can easily achieve both consistency and availability at the same time without any issues. The CAP principle doesn't make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance as there is no need to make tradeoffs among these properties due to the absence of partition tolerance in such systems.	416.3644850289225
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	QdrantClient	all-MiniLM-L6-v2	 The CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) principle doesn't directly apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because in such a setup, there are no partitions. In a single-node setup, the database can provide both strong consistency and high availability since there is only one copy of the data and it's not split across different nodes. However, if you have a replicated MongoDB setup with multiple nodes for high availability, then the CAP theorem comes into play as the database has to choose between consistency and availability in case of a network partition.	0.3471617
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	QdrantClient	all-mpnet-base-v2	 The CAP principle, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, does not apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because it operates in a single data center without any network partitions. In this scenario, the system can maintain both consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time) and availability (the system is always reachable), as there are no partitions or network delays to deal with. The CAP theorem is primarily used to describe the trade-offs that distributed databases must make when faced with these three conflicting goals.	0.39104754
Why does the CAP principle not make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance?	QdrantClient	nomic-embed-text-v1	" The CAP principle doesn't apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because it assumes distributed systems where consistency, availability, and partition tolerance are conflicting goals due to network delays or failures. In a single-node setup, data is stored on a single server, so there are no network partitions, and the system can achieve both consistency (all operations follow the ""strict"" consistency model) and availability (the database always responds to read/write requests). However, MongoDB provides flexible consistency guarantees across distributed systems, offering trade-offs between strong consistency, eventual consistency, and other options."	0.4468252

from datetime import datetime

# Define the time period you're interested in
start = '2015-01-01'
end = '2015-12-31'

# Use Audius API to get data for the given period (You would replace this with Spotify's API)
audius_data = pdr.get_datareader('audius', 'streaming_stats', start=start, end=end)

# Filter for artists and sum up the streams for each artist
artist_streams = audius_data['streams'].groupby(level=0).sum()

# Find the artist with the most total streams in 2015
most_streamed_artist = artist_streams.idxmax()
print(f'The most streamed artist on {Audius.name} in 2015 was {most_streamed_artist}.')
